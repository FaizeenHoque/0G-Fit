# Astronaut Health Monitor

## Overview

The **Astronaut Health Monitor** is a Python-based application designed to help astronauts maintain their health and well-being during space missions. By monitoring vital signs, exercise regimens, medication intake, sleep patterns, and facilitating telemedicine consultations, this application aims to mitigate the adverse effects of microgravity on the human body.

## Features

1. **Microgravity Effects Monitoring**
   - **Muscle Atrophy & Bone Density Loss:** Tracks muscle health and bone density, ensuring astronauts engage in necessary exercise routines.
   - **Exercise Regimens Tracking:** Integrates with space exercise equipment to monitor workout sessions and adherence to NASA's exercise protocols.
   - **Medication & Supplement Alerts:** Provides reminders for taking essential medications and supplements like Vitamin D and bisphosphonates.

2. **Sleep Disruptions Management**
   - **Circadian Rhythm Optimization:** Syncs with adjustable lighting systems to simulate natural day-night cycles and offers personalized lighting recommendations.
   - **Sleep Quality Monitoring:** Monitors sleep patterns and suggests adjustments to enhance sleep quality.
   - **Private Sleeping Quarters Management:** Allows astronauts to customize their sleeping environment for optimal comfort.

3. **Health and Medical Challenges**
   - **Telemedicine Integration:** Facilitates real-time consultations with medical experts on Earth.
   - **Vital Health Monitoring:** Continuously tracks vital signs, immune function, and muscle health to preemptively address potential medical issues.
   - **Research and Immune Function Tracking:** Monitors immune function in microgravity and provides personalized strategies based on ongoing research.

## Installation

To run the Astronaut Health Monitor, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Clone this repository and run the script as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astronaut-health-monitor.git
cd astronaut-health-monitor
python astronaut_health_monitor.py
```

## Usage
The application provides a simulation of astronaut health monitoring. Key functionalities include:

**Log Vitals**: View current health metrics such as heart rate, muscle health, and immune function.
**Take Medicine**: Log medication intake for essential supplements.
**Perform Exercise**: Track daily exercise and its impact on muscle and bone health.
**Track Sleep**: Monitor hours slept and adjust sleep quality accordingly.
**Sync with Lighting**: Manage lighting conditions to support circadian rhythms.
**Telemedicine Consultation**: Connect with Earth for medical support and guidance.
**Monitor Vitals**: Randomly update and monitor vital signs to simulate real-time health tracking.

## Example
An example of usage is provided in the script, where a fictional astronaut named Commander Shepard undergoes daily routines such as exercise, medication intake, vital monitoring, and telemedicine consultations.

```python
# Example usage
astronaut = AstronautHealthMonitor(astronaut_name="Commander Shepard")
astronaut.perform_exercise()
astronaut.take_medicine("Vitamin D")
astronaut.monitor_vitals()
astronaut.sync_with_lighting(datetime.now())
astronaut.track_sleep(hours_slept=6)
astronaut.telemedicine_consultation(issue="Low immune function")
astronaut.reset_medicine()
```
